# Chrome Luminati Proxy Configurator

A Chrome extension designed specifically for helping utilize the Luminati proxy
service. A *core* feature is the ability to *initiate new sessions* via a 
simple button click.

## Configuration

Supply the desired proxy hostname (and port), username, password, and a whitelist
of sites that should be requested through the proxy. If you would like all
requests to be proxied, supply a value of `*` for `Proxy Whitelist`.
